## What it does

Scheduled Exports run recent Apple Health exports daily, weekly, or on a custom calendar cadence using the same iPhone settings as Manual Export, including formats, metrics, paths, write mode, and **Data Detail**. Custom schedules can repeat every N days, weeks, or months, covering patterns such as every other day or monthly. Targets are iPhone Folder, API Endpoint, or an already-open/connected Mac.

Scheduling is available on the free plan. A scheduled request that exports at least one date consumes one of the same 10 free export actions used by manual, Shortcut, and direct exports, regardless of how many dates or files the request contains. Retries of that same durable request do not consume another use. Full Access removes the shared limit.

Data Detail defaults to Summary for new installs. Detailed Time-Series adds selected samples without the canonical archive; Lossless Health Records adds both and can be large, so enable it intentionally and start with a short lookback.

## Setup

1. Open **Schedule** and enable Scheduled Exports.
2. Grant notification permission for recovery.
3. Choose Daily, Weekly, or Custom; then set the time, lookback, and destination. Custom schedules also have an interval unit and start date that establishes the repeating phase.
4. Configure metrics, formats, and Data Detail on Export.
5. Optional: enable Today Refresh every 3/6/12 hours.

Each new completed-day profile occurrence re-exports the **entire configured lookback**, including dates exported by earlier runs. A daily 08:00 schedule with a 14-day lookback therefore sends all 14 completed days every morning, ending yesterday. If execution is delayed, the window stays anchored to the scheduled fire day rather than shifting to the wake-up day. Successful occurrences are not repeated by duplicate wake-ups; retries export only their exact unresolved dates. Today Refresh independently re-fetches only the current day when iOS permits and does not replace the completed-day lookback. File targets use Update/Overwrite to replace the daily JSON snapshot; API Endpoint targets resend the complete snapshot so the receiver can replace or upsert that date.

## What gets exported

- selected summary metrics;
- selected compatibility samples when Detailed Time-Series or Lossless is selected;
- canonical source archive in JSON/CSV when Lossless Health Records is selected;
- summary + diagnostic Markdown/Bases;
- daily-note injection and individual entries for file targets, if enabled;
- roll-ups, if explicitly enabled.

Canonical records use strict source-start day ownership. Sleep summary keeps its established noon-to-noon night attribution, so the next completed-day pass remains the final compatibility summary for yesterday. Users who select the **Morning ends** sleep-attribution mode (issue #104) instead capture yesterday's night session in this morning's note; the device-local setting is read at each capture, so already-captured records never move retroactively.

## Completeness

Scheduled file/upload completion and source-capture completeness are separate. Review `raw_capture_status` in each v8 daily record:

- `complete` can include successful empty queries;
- `partial` retains successful data but records incomplete branches;
- `not_requested` means canonical archive capture was off; detailed compatibility series may still be present;
- `legacy_unavailable` means an older source could not provide it.

A downstream automation should not equate a written file with a complete canonical archive.

## Pending recovery

Before a scheduled occurrence, Health.md persists exact requested dates, source, schedule kind, destination snapshot, fire date, and notification routing metadata. It does not store HealthKit samples in the worker.

If HealthKit is protected while locked, the unresolved dates remain pending. Partial runs remove exact terminal dates (successfully written/uploaded days and iPhone HealthKit no-data outcomes) and keep only retryable dates, preventing append-mode duplicates. Missing Mac cache data remains retryable because a later iPhone sync may populate it. The immediate “Health Export Needs Attention” notification carries the stable pending request ID; Health.md does not announce an incomplete run as completed. Open Health.md and tap to retry. Duplicate triggers reuse pending identity and in-flight IDs prevent concurrent duplicate runs or re-expansion of completed dates. Whichever trigger actually runs the request — notification tap, app-open catch-up, or Connected Mac handshake resume — the run is presented through the scheduled-export activity banner with live progress; on a cold-launch notification tap the app-open drain may win the race and own the banner, and a result is never surfaced as a standalone alert. **Cancel Export** stops only the current attempt: it does not disable the schedule, completed dates stay completed, and unresolved dates remain queued for a later retry. The +60s fallback notification armed for a profile occurrence carries that profile's identity (exact dates, destination, frozen settings), so a tap runs the profile's own export while profile scheduling owns the wake-up; legacy-shaped requests are never armed while only profile entries are enabled. A preserved retry and its recovery notification survive wake-up re-arms and profile edits — only not-yet-fired fallback notifications are canceled when automation is re-armed or disabled — and the armed fallback is defused the moment its retry starts running, so it never surfaces mid-run.

## Scheduling/privacy architecture

Health.md combines on-device background tasks/HealthKit delivery/app-open catch-up with best-effort silent APNs. The worker may store APNs/install/platform/schedule/timezone metadata. It does not store HealthKit samples, export files, vault contents, API URLs, or API secrets.

Custom cadence details stay on device. Until the worker supports calendar intervals directly, Health.md registers custom schedules as daily wake-ups and rejects off-cadence pushes locally using the saved interval, unit, and start date.

Silent push cannot guarantee runtime or bypass locked-device protection. User-visible recovery stays local to avoid server/local notification races.

## Server-visible APNs fallback decision

Decision: no server-visible APNs alert. Health.md uses the client pending request plus local notification fallback for visible recovery. This keeps health/routing state on device and helps avoid duplicate notifications when silent push, app-open catch-up, and a notification tap overlap. A future server-visible alert would require explicit completion acknowledgement before it could be safe.

## Connected Mac behavior

Connected Mac schedules require an open, compatible, ready Mac to begin; they do not wake it. Current peers use peer-bound durable checksum-validated sessions. A disconnect, scheduler wait timeout, or iPhone app suspension pauses rather than cancels the persisted job; reopening Health.md and reconnecting the same Mac resumes from its acknowledged partition frontier until the fixed seven-day expiry. The scheduler invocation may stop waiting while the job continues. Peers without bounded per-date completion capability remain ineligible. Large one-day HealthKit capture/final serialization can still use substantial memory even though aggregate resume storage and frames are bounded.

## Practical guidance

- Progress is always visible while an export runs: an in-app activity banner for normal exports, a banner plus lock-screen Live Activity for CLI-triggered exports, and local notifications for scheduled results. Manual and scheduled in-app banners include their Stop/Cancel action; banners dismiss automatically when the run finishes.

- Begin with a one-day lookback.
- Use Update/Overwrite for repeated dates.
- Split route/ECG/clinical/attachment-heavy history into manual backfills.
- Review Export History and per-file lossless diagnostics.
- HealthKit denied read access can look successfully empty; Health.md cannot bypass that privacy behavior.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Schedule did not complete | iOS delay, lock protection, target unavailable, or free quota exhausted | Unlock/tap the recovery notification or open the app to drain pending work. If all 10 free exports are used, unlock Full Access to resume. |
| File exists but archive is partial | One source branch failed/cancelled/skipped/unsupported | Inspect manifest/diagnostics; retry if recoverable. |
| No archive | Lossless off or legacy peer | Review Export setting and update peers. |
| Mac schedule fails | Mac closed/not ready/incompatible | Open/update Mac, select folder, retry pending/history. |
| API 413 or high memory use | Receiver limit is below the bounded batch, or one lossless day is too large | Select fewer metrics, use summary-only, or raise the receiver's request limit. |
| No visible notification | Permission denied/iOS suppressed it | Enable notifications and open Health.md for catch-up. |

## Video outline

- **Suggested title:** Automate Lossless Apple Health Exports Safely
- **Hook:** “Schedule exact records, then verify capture completeness instead of trusting file presence alone.”
- **Demo flow:** configure one-day schedule, show pending lock recovery, inspect status/manifest, and explain API/Mac size limits.

## Implementation notes

- `ExportSchedule` stores frequency, custom interval/unit/start date, time, lookback, and target.
- `ScheduledExportCoordinator` persists exact `PendingExportRequest` values.
- `SchedulingManager` runs local/API/bounded Connected Mac pipelines with current settings.
- `ExportNotificationScheduler` uses deterministic pending identifiers.
- Worker silent pushes carry routing/schedule metadata only.
