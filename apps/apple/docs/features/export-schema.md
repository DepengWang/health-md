# Export schema contract

Health.md exports are durable public files for Obsidian, scripts, spreadsheets, archives, and downstream automation. The exhaustive user/developer contract, complete generated examples, and field inventories are indexed in the [Health.md export reference](../reference/index.md). JSON, CSV, and Obsidian Bases always identify their schema. Markdown identifies it in frontmatter when the user-controlled **Include Metadata** setting is on (the default); turning that setting off removes the entire Markdown frontmatter block:

- Markdown frontmatter when **Include Metadata** is on, and Obsidian Bases frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  schema: healthmd.health_data
  schema_version: 8
  raw_capture_status: complete
  time_context:
    calendar_timezone: America/Los_Angeles
    timestamp_timezone: UTC
  ```
- JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "schema": "healthmd.health_data",
    "schema_version": 8,
    "raw_capture_status": "complete",
    "time_context": {
      "calendar_timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
      "timestamp_timezone": "UTC"
    }
  }
  ```
- CSV metadata and diagnostic rows:
  ```csv
  Date,Category,Metric,Value,Unit,Timestamp
  2026-07-15,Metadata,schema,healthmd.health_data,,
  2026-07-15,Metadata,schema_version,8,,
  2026-07-15,Raw HealthKit,Raw Capture Status,complete,status,
  ```

## Version 8 live schema

`schema_version: 8` is the current Apple Health.md daily export contract. Versions 5, 6, and 7 and their signature fixtures remain historical and must not be rewritten. Android frozen v4 and Android analytical v5 are unchanged.

Version 8 carries forward the complete lossless source representation and v7 summary corrections, and adds the optional typed `providers.whoop` section described below. The v7 corrections remain part of v8:

- `vo2_max` is a latest measurement, not a period maximum. Its period headline follows the latest daily source value even when that value is lower than an earlier measurement.
- CSV extended summary categories, including cycling, vitamins, minerals, reproductive health, and other health, populate canonical `Unit` values from the production data dictionary instead of dropping them.
- Roll-up date labels are rendered in the calendar timezone used to build the period, so ISO weekly output labels Monday through Sunday and agrees with its `YYYY-Www` period ID.

**Data Detail defaults to Summary for new installs.** Detailed Time-Series may add existing optional sample arrays while still reporting `raw_capture_status: not_requested`; that status describes only canonical archive capture. Lossless Health Records adds both readable selected series and the canonical source archive. Historical `includeGranularData` values migrate exactly: `true` becomes Lossless and `false` or missing becomes Summary. New durable settings use independent compatibility-detail and HealthKit-source-archive policies.

Clinical Health Records access is temporarily absent from current App Store builds. Those builds omit the managed entitlements, privacy prompt, metric-selection categories, direct-query catalog entries, and clinical capture. The v8 schema retains its clinical/FHIR/CDA/verifiable variants so historical files stay decodable and the capability can return in a future schema-compatible release.

## Summary, provider, and source layers

A v8 daily record has three complementary layers:

1. Existing `sleep`, `activity`, `heart`, `vitals`, `body`, `nutrition`, `mindfulness`, `mobility`, `hearing`, `workouts`, and medication summaries remain convenient for reading, charts, and roll-ups.
2. Optional `providers.whoop` contains reviewed typed WHOOP facts under its independently versioned `healthmd.provider.whoop_daily` v1 contract. Provider values never overwrite or relabel Apple summaries.
3. JSON `healthkit_record_archive` is the authoritative Apple source layer. It uses `schema: healthmd.healthkit_records` and `schema_version: 1`.

The archive is the complete public representation Health.md captured from the selected HealthKit APIs. Downstream tools that need source identity, exact samples, or relationships should read it instead of treating summary arrays as authoritative.

Format roles are intentional:

- **JSON** embeds the full archive.
- **CSV** writes the same canonical objects as RFC 4180-safe JSON rows: `Archive Manifest`, `Raw HealthKit Record`, `Raw HealthKit External Record`, query failures, warnings, and partial failures. Canonical JSON and CSV record UUIDs must match.
- **Markdown and Obsidian Bases** keep daily summaries readable and do not dump the archive. Their shared frontmatter exposes capture status, source-record count, failed-query count, warning count, and archive schema. Markdown additionally renders external-record, query-status, and medication-inventory counts in its compact diagnostics section.
- **Individual Entry Tracking** derives source-event files from canonical HealthKit records whenever an archive is present. WHOOP v1 records do not participate in Individual Entry Tracking.

## Typed WHOOP provider section

When WHOOP capture is enabled and an Apple Health day is retained, v8 may add `providers.whoop`. Provider-only days remain non-exportable. The same WHOOP fetch also continues to supply provider-native `healthmd.external_provider_daily` v1 sidecars; the typed section does not replace or weaken that fidelity layer.

The nested section preserves WHOOP cycles, recoveries, sleep/nap records, workouts, and the current-day body-profile snapshot. Provider IDs are strings; duration fields retain exact integer milliseconds; the recent-nap adjustment retains its signed value; current v2 workout `sport_name` and cycle/sleep relationships are preserved. WHOOP HRV is named `hrv_rmssd_ms` and is never projected into Apple `hrv_ms` (SDNN).

`capture_status` is `complete`, `partial`, or `not_requested`. Every planned resource has one deterministic result row with a matching typed-record count. A successful empty request is complete with zero records; partial capture keeps successful siblings and exposes only bounded safe errors. Typed output never includes credentials, headers, URLs, pagination cursors, account identity, or raw provider error bodies.

Format projections are deliberately loss-aware:

- JSON retains the complete typed nested section.
- Markdown renders labeled WHOOP summaries and repeated-record tables.
- Bases/frontmatter emits stable `whoop_*` scalars only when exactly one relevant record supplies the value.
- CSV retains the six-column contract, writes the same unambiguous scalars, and uses canonical JSON rows for repeated records. Provider fetch time is never substituted for a measurement timestamp.
- WHOOP dictionary entries declare no weekly, monthly, or yearly roll-ups.

The normative schema, mapping rules, and synthetic fixture are under `packages/contracts/proposals/provider-sections-v1` in the repository.

## Canonical archive contract

Each UUID-backed HealthKit record preserves, when the public API provides it:

- original HealthKit UUID, object-type identifier, and record kind;
- exact UTC start and end timestamps plus `has_undetermined_duration`;
- source name, bundle identifier, version, product type, and operating-system major/minor/patch;
- every public `HKDevice` field;
- recursively typed metadata, including null, string, Boolean, signed and unsigned integers, floating point, date, binary data, URL, quantity, array, dictionary, and an explicit unsupported-value description;
- exact quantity values and canonical units, quantity sample subclass/kind, count, min/average/max/most-recent/sum statistics, and series children with owning-sample identity;
- category raw values and known symbolic values without discarding unknown raws;
- structured payloads, binary references, and unknown future payload kinds;
- UUID and external-identity relationships, including cross-day owner hints;
- direct/dependency metric attribution and the reason the object was retained.

The archive also includes:

- deterministic daily ownership metadata;
- a query manifest with operation, type, selected metrics, interval, status, record count, and safe error details;
- integrity warnings;
- medication inventory records;
- UUID-free `external_records` for public values that are not `HKObject`s.

Health.md never fabricates an HKObject UUID, source revision, or device for an external value. Activity summaries, profile characteristics, attachments, and WorkoutKit schedules use only their public external identity. For historical or future compatible clinical records, the schema preserves the public `HKClinicalRecord` UUID but labels its documented instability; when FHIR identity fields are available, a separate stable content identity is included and does not disguise the unstable UUID.

## Capture and query completeness

Top-level `raw_capture_status` and archive `capture_status` use these values:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `complete` | Every planned, supported request completed without a failed, cancelled, skipped, or unsupported branch. A complete archive may contain zero records. |
| `partial` | At least one requested branch failed, was cancelled, skipped, unsupported, or otherwise could not be captured. Retained siblings remain valid. |
| `not_requested` | Lossless Health Records was explicitly off for this export. No archive is present. |
| `legacy_unavailable` | The record came from an older app/peer that could not provide the archive. |

Query-manifest status is separate:

- `success` with `record_count: 0` means a successful empty query;
- `unsupported` means the API or capability is unavailable on this runtime;
- `skipped` means Health.md intentionally did not query, commonly because separate authorization was not granted;
- `cancelled` records user or request cancellation;
- `failure` includes a structured error.

No partial capture may be labeled complete. Errors are isolated where possible: one failed waveform, attachment, route, or specialized query does not discard successful sibling records.

HealthKit protects read privacy. For many types, a denied read can be indistinguishable from a successful empty result. Health.md reports what the public API returns; it cannot override that privacy behavior.

## Day ownership and deduplication

Canonical source records use one strict rule: a record belongs to the captured calendar day when its **source start date** falls in that day's half-open interval in the captured IANA timezone. Raw start/end timestamps are never clipped to day boundaries, even when a record spans midnight.

This differs from the established sleep compatibility summary. Daily sleep summaries retain their noon-to-noon journaling behavior so an evening sleep session remains attached to the night users expect. Consumers reconstructing raw events must use archive ownership, not infer ownership from the summary window.

The shared **Sleep Day Attribution** setting (`settings.sleep-attribution`, issue #104) lets the user choose between two compatibility projections. **Night begins** (default) keeps the shipped noon-to-noon window and its boundary clipping; it must not be read as a promise that every arbitrarily long source session remains whole. **Morning ends** attributes each captured source session to the calendar date of its end (wake-up date), matching the Health Connect UI, and retains that owned session without noon clipping. InBed evidence is authoritative for overlapping sessions; stage-only evidence uses the same bounded sessionization as `HealthMdSleepSessionQuery`, where gaps through exactly 90 minutes remain one inferred session and larger gaps split. The device-local timezone and setting are snapshotted together at capture entry, apply to every capture path, and change only summary ownership — never sleep values, units, reducers, stage identities, or schema shape. Canonical source-record ownership is unaffected either way.

Repeated query views are merged only by the same original UUID. UUID-free public values are merged only by the same documented external identity. Similar values, timestamps, or payloads are never enough to deduplicate distinct records.

## Public coverage

Subject to the selected metrics, runtime API availability, and authorization, v8 Apple source capture covers:

- all currently catalogued ordinary quantity and category types, including reproductive and pregnancy types;
- discrete, cumulative, and series quantity samples with exact public statistics and child points;
- category values with raw and known symbolic values;
- blood-pressure and food correlations with their component graph;
- full workouts, routes and locations, events, activities, all public statistics, associated quantity/category/specialized samples, effort relationships, and attached or scheduled WorkoutKit plans;
- ECG waveforms, audiograms, heartbeat series, GAD-7/PHQ-9 scored assessments, and State of Mind;
- medication inventory and dose events;
- Activity summaries and profile characteristics;
- vision prescriptions;
- attachment metadata and exact available attachment bytes.

The schema also retains clinical/FHIR, CDA, and verifiable clinical record variants for historical and future compatible producers, but current App Store builds do not request or capture those types.

This is public-API completeness, not access to Apple's private database. Health.md does not infer unavailable sleep schedules, alarms, ECG leads, measurement sessions, or other private fields.

## Special authorization and capability behavior

Most selected HealthKit types use the normal read-authorization flow. Some types behave differently:

- medications and vision prescriptions use Apple's per-object selectors and are opt-in;
- clinical records, CDA documents, and verifiable clinical records are source-gated off in current App Store builds;
- WorkoutKit schedules use a separate read-only capability path with no HealthKit authorization prompt;
- unavailable runtime APIs are `unsupported`; deliberately unrequested special access is `skipped` rather than a false successful-empty result.

Metric selection controls both direct records and required relationship dependencies. Archive records retain direct/dependency attribution so selecting Workouts, blood pressure, or food does not silently claim every child type as a directly selected metric.

## Exact binary data and URLs

Binary metadata, FHIR JSON, CDA bytes, verifiable records, WorkoutKit representations, and available attachments are base64 encoded by canonical JSON. Attachment records include exact byte availability and SHA-256 checksums when bytes were read. An empty available attachment has the checksum of empty data; unavailable bytes do not get a fabricated checksum.

Source URLs are preserved as strings. Health.md never fetches them, follows them, or treats remote content as captured data.

## Summary correctness notes

- Blood-pressure summaries retain daily average/minimum/maximum values. The canonical archive contains actual correlation pairs and Health.md does not infer sessions or average nearby readings.
- VO2 Max may use the latest historical measurement through the end of the requested day. Its UUID, source start/end, carry-forward flag, and age are exported so it cannot masquerade as an in-day reading. The v8 dictionary retains the v7 `vo2_max` rule as `latest`; weekly/monthly/yearly headline values select the latest daily value rather than the largest value.
- **Stand Time** is summed duration in minutes from `HKQuantityTypeIdentifierAppleStandTime`. **Stand Hours** is the count of distinct stood hours from Apple Stand Hour category records. They are not interchangeable.
- Vitamin/mineral summaries and the v8 data dictionary retain the v7 microgram contract: microgram values use `µg`, while milligram summaries use `mg`. Canonical HealthKit quantity payloads preserve the reviewed HealthKit query unit string (`mcg` for those microgram source types).

## Time and unit contract

`time_context.calendar_timezone` is the captured IANA timezone used for daily boundaries and human-readable clock fields. `time_context.timestamp_timezone` is always `UTC`. Complete source timestamps use RFC 3339 UTC with a fixed nine-digit fractional component in canonical rows. `HKTimeZone` metadata remains source metadata and may differ during travel.

Structured summary data uses stable canonical units regardless of Metric/Imperial display preference:

- frontmatter/Bases and JSON use the `units` map;
- CSV uses the `Unit` column, including data-dictionary units for extended cycling, vitamin, mineral, reproductive, and other summary rows;
- distance keys with explicit suffixes identify their own units;
- Markdown prose may use the selected display units;
- Markdown has no machine-readable schema or `units` map when **Include Metadata** is off.

See [Date, Time, and Units](./date-time-units.md) and [Data Dictionary and Roll-up Rules](./data-dictionary.md).

## Range-summary contract

New range summaries are not daily-v8 documents. They use the independent public identity `healthmd.rollup_summary` v9 while declaring `healthmd.health_data` v8 as their source schema and roll-up rules version 8. Requested civil bounds and the IANA calendar timezone are frozen before capture, so failed edge-day queries reduce coverage without changing the period ID or bounds. Historical weekly/monthly/yearly roll-up v8 artifacts remain valid and are not relabeled. See [Range summary and historical roll-ups](./rollup-summaries.md) and `packages/contracts/rollup-summary/v9`.

## API Endpoint envelope

API Endpoint export wraps ordinary v8 daily records in `healthmd.api_export`. The daily record version is declared by `daily_record_schema_version`; each `records` item still contains its own schema/version, optional typed provider section, and archive. API v2 retains provider-native sidecars under `external_records` in addition to the typed daily provider data.

## Practical limits

- Health.md can preserve only data exposed by public HealthKit and WorkoutKit APIs on the running OS.
- Current exports are snapshots. They do not include historical deletion tombstones from earlier snapshots.
- Lossless files can be large, especially with routes, ECG voltage measurements, series, FHIR/CDA data, or attachments.
- Current connected iPhone/Mac jobs use peer-bound durable checksum-chained corpus sessions with 32–64 MiB partitions (48 MiB default) and 512 KiB frames. A logical day/item may span any number of physical partitions without a product-level item or corpus cap. A protected bounded iPhone journal and durable Mac frontier resume after reconnect/app relaunch without retransmitting committed gigabytes. Mixed-version peers retain the legacy 2 GiB single-payload cap. These are transport/lifecycle changes only and do not change daily export schema keys or versions.
- API Endpoint exports use sequential batches bounded by 7 calendar days and an 8 MiB encoded-body target by default. A single daily record is indivisible and can exceed that target; the API envelope and daily schemas are unchanged.
- HealthKit capture and final JSON/CSV serialization can still use substantial memory. Export smaller date ranges when working with dense records or attachments.

## Migrating from v5, v6, or v7

Existing v5, v6, and v7 files remain valid historical exports. Do not relabel them as v8. Re-export v6 periods when consumers need the corrected VO2 Max `latest` rule, populated extended-category CSV units, or calendar-timezone-correct roll-up date labels; v6 dictionaries described `vo2_max` as a maximum. Re-export v7 days when consumers need typed WHOOP data inside the daily record.

For a consistent archive, update Health.md and its Obsidian integration, then re-export the dates you need. Re-exporting is especially important when downstream tools need canonical source records, corrected day ownership, exact quantities, VO2 provenance and roll-ups, Stand Time/Stand Hours separation, or corrected micronutrient units.

Downstream parser guidance:

1. Branch on top-level `schema` and `schema_version`; accept v5, v6, v7, and v8 during migration.
2. Treat summary objects as convenient projections, not source-event identity.
3. In v6 through v8, inspect `raw_capture_status` before deciding whether an archive should exist.
4. Parse `healthkit_record_archive.schema` and its independent `schema_version`.
5. Treat typed metadata as tagged values; preserve unknown tags and raw enum values.
6. Use UUID/external identity for deduplication and `ownership.owner_date` for raw day assignment.
7. Check every query result and diagnostic. Never interpret `partial` as complete or missing fields as zero.
8. Use CSV canonical JSON rows without lossy cell parsing; RFC 4180 fields may contain commas, quotes, and newlines.

## Internal semantic-input migration boundary

Apple converts already-captured provider-free `HealthData` into bounded `healthmd.semantic_input` v1 batches for deterministic Rust filtering, typed reduction, and Apple period-rollup planning. The session explicitly carries disabled frontmatter output keys and whether platform archive extensions may be retained, so previously captured data cannot bypass current output settings. This internal envelope is not `healthmd.health_data`, is never written to a destination, and does not change schema version 8. HealthKit querying/statistics, sleep day ownership, archive payloads, source/device metadata, localization, and provider capture/rendering remain native. Provider-bearing days fail closed to native authority rather than dropping typed provider data. SDK-produced daily values cross as explicit aggregate facts so the migration does not recompute HealthKit statistics from raw samples.

## Internal render and artifact-plan migration boundary

A completed semantic result and frozen presentation snapshot may enter `healthmd.render_input` v1. The shared core renders destination-neutral provider-free Apple-v8 artifacts and returns validated relative paths, media types, write modes, exact bytes, byte counts, and checksums. Large archive JSON/CSV items and attachments use a bounded stream that never retains a second complete output buffer. Security-scoped URLs, destination reads, atomic writes, ZIP containers, API networking, credentials, provider sections, and direct transport remain native.

Pre-cutover Swift v7 renderer bytes remain frozen independently under `packages/contracts/render-input/v1/fixtures/native-apple-v7.json`. The active Rust profile is `apple_health_data_v8`; provider-bearing operations remain native-authoritative. Release defaults remain legacy until the existing rollout gates pass.

## Schema version policy and guardrail

`HealthMdExportSchema.version` is the production daily schema integer. Version 8 is current; versions 1 through 7 are historical. The committed v5, v6, and v7 signatures remain preserved byte-for-byte; v8 has its own versioned fixture.

Bump the daily schema when a public key, type, meaning, unit, aggregation, JSON structure, CSV contract, reserved frontmatter field, or downstream dictionary rule changes. Do not bump for byte-compatible internal refactors.

`HealthMdTests/Export/ExportSchemaSignatureTests.swift` fingerprints JSON paths, CSV rows/headers, Markdown/Bases frontmatter, and the data dictionary. A shipped version's fixture must never be rewritten merely to silence CI.

The deterministic metric/profile inventory now comes from the shared Rust `metric-registry-v1.json`. Generated `HealthMetrics` and `HealthMetricExportMapping` regions preserve the existing native IDs, units, order, and keys; Swift continues to own HealthKit selectors, availability, permissions, persistence, localization, queries, and native-only rendering surfaces. UniFFI shadow tests compare the packaged registry to these generated projections. The registry now exposes the explicit Apple v8 profile. This internal authority change does not alter Android frozen v4 or Android analytical v5.

## Cross-platform-first rule

Apple export design follows the repository-wide Apple and Android unification policy at `../../docs/architecture/cross-platform-unification-policy.md` (referenced as a path, not a link, because Apple docs cannot link outside `apps/apple`). Before adding or changing an Apple metric, provider, setting, format projection, or automation behavior:

1. Define the platform-neutral meaning and inspect the corresponding Health Connect/Android capability.
2. Use the common semantic ID, canonical unit, statistic, completeness model, and unified-contract mapping only when equivalence is proven.
3. Put HealthKit-only or non-equivalent data in an explicit Apple capability/platform contract rather than emitting an Android placeholder.
4. Record Android as unavailable with an OS/API reason or planned with a concrete target when the feature cannot land together.
5. Update and test Android, shared-core, CLI, website, API/automation, and external Obsidian consumers when their boundary is affected.

Apple v8 remains a shipped Apple profile. New common behavior should converge through the reviewed unified successor rather than changing Android v4/v5 or Apple v8 semantics in place.

## Intentional schema change workflow

1. Define the shared outcome and compare Apple and Android source semantics.
2. Choose the change lane:
   - **Apple production profile:** change the Apple exporter or Apple platform section, decide whether Apple public v8 advances, and follow the Apple signature workflow below.
   - **Unified proposal/common profile:** change the language-neutral common contract, ledger, schema, and synthetic fixtures. Do **not** bump `HealthMdExportSchema.version` or regenerate an Apple signature unless a separately approved Apple production writer adopts that schema.
3. For an Apple production schema change, bump `HealthMdExportSchema.version`.
4. Run `make update-export-schema-signature`.
5. Review the new versioned fixture; do not overwrite a shipped fixture.
6. Run exporter contract tests, affected cross-platform consumer tests, and a mixed v5/v6/v7/v8 export smoke test.

RFC-0004 currently blocks production unified-v9 writers, so proposal-only v9 work remains in the second lane.

A release smoke test should cover local iPhone, API, and Connected Mac outputs; summary-only and lossless settings; Markdown/Bases readability; canonical JSON/CSV parity; and an updated downstream Obsidian parser.
