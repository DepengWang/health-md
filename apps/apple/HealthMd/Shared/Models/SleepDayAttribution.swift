import Foundation

/// Which daily note owns a sleep session.
///
/// Shared cross-platform setting (issue #104). Both platforms persist the same
/// raw values and default to `nightBegins`.
///
/// - `nightBegins`: the shipped noon-to-noon journaling window clips summary
///   intervals at its boundaries. It remains the default so existing exports
///   never change silently.
/// - `morningEnds`: the note for the wake-up date (the calendar date of the
///   session end) owns the whole session, matching the Health Connect UI.
